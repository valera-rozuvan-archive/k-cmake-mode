# k-cmake-mode
cmake-mode.el --- major-mode for editing CMake sources


## Introduction

This is a 1-to-1 copy of **cmake-mode.el** file distributed by Kitware.
[See original](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Auxiliary/cmake-mode.el).
Why have this repository? So that you can easily clone it, and have just the **.el** file
without the whole source tree of CMake. I use it for my **orome-emacs** project.
